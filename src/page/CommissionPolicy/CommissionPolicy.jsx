            <li>Please provide clear illustrated + colored reference pictures of character you want me to draw. I do not accept text descriptions only as reference because I will get lost and make a lot of mistakes.</li>
            <li>If you would like some certain size / dimension for the artwork, please let me know when you fill the commission form.</li>
